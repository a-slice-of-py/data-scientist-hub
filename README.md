**Data Scientist Hub (DSH)** is my personal knowledge center.

<!-- [=75% "current website progress 75%"]{: .candystripe .candystripe-animate} -->

DSH is definitely a living creature, always under development and I expect - and somehow _wish_ - frequent changes in both contents and shape.

It is currently implemented via [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

You can visit the current deployed version [here](http://a-slice-of-py.github.io/data-scientist-hub/).

- `feat` ➜ new project features
- `fix` ➜ bug fixing
- `data` ➜ contents update
- `refactor` ➜ light code refactoring
- `style` ➜ code style update
- `wip` ➜ backup commits
- `misc` ➜ none of the above
