DSH is definitely a living creature, always under development and I expect - and somehow _wish_ - frequent changes in both contents and shape.
Here you can see me developing DSH ðŸ¤“ (animation built via the wonderful [Gource](https://gource.io/)).

It is currently implemented via [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
