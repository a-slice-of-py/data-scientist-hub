**Data Scientist Hub (DSH)** is my personal knowledge center.

<!-- [=75% "current website progress 75%"]{: .candystripe .candystripe-animate} -->

DSH is definitely a living creature, always under development and I expect - and somehow _wish_ - frequent changes in both contents and shape.
It is currently implemented via [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
