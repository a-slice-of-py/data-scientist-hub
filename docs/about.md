[![Built with Material for MkDocs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Material_for_MkDocs-526CFE?style=for-the-badge&logo=MaterialForMkDocs&logoColor=white)](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

**Data Scientist Hub (DSH)** is my personal knowledge center.

DSH is definitely a living creature, always under development and I expect - and somehow _wish_ - frequent changes in both contents and shape.
It is currently implemented via [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

It all started with random mails to myself to store somewhere useful links I came across, then became a Trello board and now is a full mkdocs project with a useful search feature to quickly retrieve references together with a brand new blog which I hope to update frequently - insipiration about TIL approach taken from [koaning](https://koaning.io/til/).
